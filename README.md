# Heart Disease Predictor

Logistic Regression machine learning model for predicting heart disease in patients according to their symptoms.

# Usage
The model is being served on Heroku [here](http://itc-heart-disease-predictor.herokuapp.com/)

You can just fill out the form for a patient's symptoms and predict the likelihood of a heart disease.

# Dataset
Kaggle's [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) dataset compiled by [Ronit Feldman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronit-feldman-a05198118/)

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
